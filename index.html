<h2>Introduction to Machine Learning & Deep Learning</h2>

<p>
The term machine learning or statistical learning refers to the science of automated detection of patterns in data. It has been widely used in tasks that require information extraction from large data sets. Examples of tasks include SPAM detection, fraudulent credit card transaction detection, face recognition by digital cameras, and voice commands recognition by personal assistance on smart-phones. Machine learning is also widely used in scientific domains such as Bioinformatics, medicine, and astronomy. One characteristic of all these applications is that a human developer cannot provide an explicit and detailed specification of how these tasks should be executed, due to the complexity of the patterns that need to be detected. </p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>This course provides a thorough grounding in the methods, techniques, and algorithms of machine learning. In the end of this course, the students should be able to describe the main concepts underlying machine learning, including for instance: 
	<ul>
      <li> (a) what is learning </li>
      <li> (b) how can a machine learning </li>
      <li> (c) what kind of problems can be solved by using machine learning approaches </li>
      <li> (d) how to formalize them as a machine learning problem, and </li>
      <li> (e) how to compare and evaluate the performance of different machine learning</li>
      <li> (f) apply machine learning methods into different use cases, using Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, among others

    </ul>
